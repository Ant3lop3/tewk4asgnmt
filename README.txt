Reflection:

finally found out how to use media queries! Now the code for different VP's gets exercuted. as for the JS side,
I am learning more as time goes on and what lines of code does what. However I would still have a hard time writing
something up from scratch. Again I guess this is one of those things that takes alot of practice and repetition. 
i would Ideally liked the ability to only be able to like/dislike a post once. But thinking about it this would be
tricky to implement as I imagine you would have to have another Db of users, then assign each user one like,one dislike
and also the ability to delete only their comment.
